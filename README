shbackup
--------

Here are simple shell scripts I use for some simple backup needs. Put on github
for my own convenience.


* Getting it and configuring it
-------------------------------
# clone it from github
cd /usr/local
git clone  git://github.com/raphinou/shbackup.git
cd shbackup
# copy sample files to final destination
cp backup_vars.sh.sample backup_vars.sh
cp backup.sh.sample backup.sh
# edit backup_vars to set server name
vi backup_vars.sh
# edit backup.sh to only call needed scripts
vi backup.sh
# edit archive_file.sh to determine which directories/files are to be backed up
vi archivefiles.sh
# add an entry in /etc/crontab like this one:
  32 23   * * *   root    cd /usr/local/shbackup/ && ./backup.sh  2>&1 1>/dev/null | grep -v "tar: Removing leading \`/' from member names"

* Usage 
-------
Variables are defined in backup_vars.sh. Note that this file is sourced by each
script. So if you start your backup at 23:59, it is possible that scripts in
the same run have a different value of the date.... By default backups are
created in a subdirectory of /data/backup named according to the date.

Let the script backup.sh calls other scripts according to your need.
